# Getting Started with ShellyControl

The [ShellyControl class](../reference/shelly_control.md) is designed to make it easy to integrate with Shelly smart switches. Specifically this library supports switches and energy meter as allows you to:

- Get the status of a device including temperature, Mac address, etc. 
- See if a device is online or not
- Read the current state of an input switch 
- Read the current state of an output relay
- Read an energy meter including power, energy, voltage, current and power factor (where available)
- Get the temperature from one or more digitial probes (connected to a Shelly Add-on)
- Change the state of an output relay (i.e. turn on or off)
- Optionally, respond to webhooks generated by the Shelly device, so that your app can wake immediately when an event occurs, such as an input being turned on.

This library supports many device types (30 at the last count) including older models no longer sold by the vendors. 

This library also isolates you from having to deal with the idiosyncrasies of the Shelly APIs. The vendor completely changed the API for generation 2 devices and later, and even with the new API it’s rather complex deal with the different model types and the API calls they support. This library includes a _shelly_models.json_ file that defines the capabilities of each model. Use the print_model_library() method to view this information.

## Initialisation

To initialise an instance of the ShellyControl class, you need to pass it:

1. A SCLogger object - use the [SCLogger](../reference/logging.md) class to get one of these.
2. A dict object containing the configuraton of the Shelly devices that you want to manage. 
  - This information is normally stored in a YAML configuration file and can be read from that file using [SCConfigManager.get_shelly_settings()](../reference/configmanager.md). 
3. If webhook support is needed, your application's threading.Event() object. This will be set when any webhook is received. 

Here's an example of a section of yaml file configuration for 3 Shelly devices

```yaml

The entries are used as follows:

| Parameter | Description | 
|:--|:--|
| ResponseTimeout | How long to wait (in seconds) before timeing out when making an API call or ping. | 
| RetryCount | How many retries to make if an API call times out. | 
| RetryDelay | How long to wait (in seconds) between retry attempts. | 
| PingAllowed | Set to False if ICMP isn't suppported by the route to your devices. |
| SimulationFileFolder | The folder to save JSON simulation files in. | 
| WebhooksEnabled | Enable or disable the webhook listener |
| WebhookHost | IP to listen for webhooks on. This should be the IP address of the machine running the app. Defaults to 0.0.0.0. |
| WebhookPort | Port to listen for webhooks on. Defaults to 8787. |
| WebhookPath | The URI path that webhooks will post to. |
| DefaultWebhooks | The webhooks to install by default. See the example above for format. Look at the SupportedWebhooks key of an initialised Shelly device to see which webhook events your device supports. Use the  get_device() call to get a device object.  |
| Devices | A list of dicts, each on defining a Shelly device. - see below |

The Devices key in the configuration block supports the following keys :

| Parameter | Description | 
|:--|:--|
| Name | Your name for this device  |
| Model | The model Shelly ID for this device. See the [Shelly Models List](shelly_models_list.md) for more. |
| Hostname | The network IP address or hostname for this device. |
| ID | Your numeric ID for this device. |
| Simulate | Set this to True if you don't have access to the device but still want to test your code. When True, this device will be in 'simulation' mode. Rather than make API calls to the device, the state will be written to and read from a local json file (with the same name as your Name entry). You can modify some of the values in this file to test your code. |
| ExpectOffline | If set to True, we can expect this device to be offline at times. No warnings will be issued when this happens |
| Inputs | A list of dicts defining the inputs (if any) for this device. This section is optional but if defined, the number of entries must match the number of inputs supported by this model. For each input, define a Name and/or an ID. <br><br>Optionally, add a **Webhooks**: True entry here to install the default webhooks on this input. |
| Outputs | A list of dicts defining the outputs (if any) for this device. This section is optional but if defined, the number of entries must match the number of outputs supported by this model. For each output, define a Name and/or an ID. <br><br>Optionally, add a **Webhooks**: True entry here to install the default webhooks on this input. |
| Meters | A list of dicts defining the meters (if any) for this device. Note that depending on the devices, the actual meters might be part of the output or seperate energy meters (EM1 API calls). Either way, in this class meters are reported seperately from outputs. This section is optional but if defined, the number of entries must match the number of meters supported by this model. For each meter, define a Name and/or an ID.<br><br>  Optionally, use the **MockRate** key to set a Watts / second metering rate for this meter when the device is in Simulation mode. |
| TempProbes | A list of dicts defining the temperature probes connected to a Shelly Add-on that's plugged into this device. For each one you must define a Name key that matches the name given to the probe in the app (see below).<br><br>  Optionally, use the **RequiresOutput** key to specify the name of an output device that constrains this temp probe. If set, the temperature reading will only be updated when this output is on.  |

Notes:

- Either a Device Name or a Device ID must be supplied.

## Custom Attrbutes 

You can add custom key/values to Devices, Inputs, Outputs and Meters if needed. For example you could add a group name to each output switch:(

```yaml
ShellyDevices:
  ...
  Devices:
    - Name: Downstairs Lights
      Model: Shelly2PMG3
      Hostname: 192.168.1.23
      ID: 100
      Inputs:
        - Name: "Living Room Switch"
          Webhooks: True
        - Name: "Kitchen Switch"
          Webhooks: True
      Outputs:
        - Name: "Living Room Relay"
          Group: Inside
        - Name: "Kitchen Relay"
          Group: Inside
    - Name: Outside Lights
      Model: Shelly2PMG3
      Hostname: 192.168.1.25
      ID: 200
      Inputs:
        - Name: "Patio Switch"
          Group: Outside
        - Name: "Car Port Switch"
          Group: Outside
      Outputs:
        - Name: "Patio Relay"
        - Name: "Car Port Relay"
    - Name: Testing
      ...
```

If you add custom attributes, you will need to include them in yoour Ceribus validation dict passed to SCConfigManager(). This will be merged in with the default validation structure:

```python
    "ShellyDevices": {
        "schema": {
            "Devices": {
                "schema": {
                    "schema": {
                        "Outputs": {
                            "schema": {
                                "schema": {
                                    "Group": {"type": "string", "required": False, "nullable": True},
                                },
                            },
                        },
                    },
                },
            },
        }
    }
```


These custom attrbutes will be printed by the print_device_status() function and available from the get_**() functions.

## Digital Temperature Probes

If you have a [Shelly Add-on](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen2/Addons/ShellySensorAddon) installed on your Shelly switch, then you can connect up to 5 ds18b20 probes to the add-on. You must setup the probe(s) as follows before adding the probe's name to the ShellyDevices:Device:TempProbes section of your config file:

Once you have connected the Shelly Add-on to your Shelly smart switch and connected your DS18B20 temperature probes to the add on, you need to configure the probes in the mobile app:

1. Go to the Shelly device you have installed the Add-on to and configure the add-on
	- Click Add-on peripherals section
	- Change to Sensor Addon and then reboot if prompted
2. After reboot, go back to same tab and click Add Add-on Peripheral
	- Select Temperature (DS18B20)
	- Select a probe listed from the automatic scan and click Add Peripheral
	- Reboot when prompted
3. After reboot, go back to same tab and click the settings gear icon next to the newly added probe
	- Give the probe a name (important) - for example "Roof Temp"
	- Optionally enable the 'extract peripheral as device' option (if you want it to appear as a seperate device on your dashboard
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for any other connected probes

Now add these probe(s) to ShellyDevices:Device:TempProbes section of your config file, being sure to use exactly the same names as you used in the Shelly app.

```yaml
ShellyDevices:
  ...
  Devices:
    - Name: Downstairs Lights
      Model: Shelly2PMG3
      Hostname: 192.168.1.23
      ...
      TempProbes:
        - Name: "Roof Temp"
```

## Future Features 

Some of the things this library might support in the future:

- Support for Authentication
- Support for other types of Shelly device
